- **Server Requirements** - Check if your server meets the new version requirements

## ðŸš€ Upgrade Process

### Step 1: Download Latest Version

Download the latest version of Bagisto from one of the following links:
- [Download From Official Bagisto Site](https://bagisto.com/en/download/)
- [Download From GitHub](https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto)

```
:::

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

1. **Copy your existing environment file:**

::: tip Safer .env Migration
Instead of copying the entire `.env` file, consider adding environment variables one by one. The latest version may introduce new variables or deprecate old ones. At this stage, you mainly need to set up database connection details and essential configuration. Review the sample `.env.example` for new options.
:::

```bash
cp /path/to/old-project/.env .env
```

2. **Update environment variables:**
```bash
# Generate new application key if needed
php artisan key:generate

# Review and update any new configuration options
nano .env
```

::: tip Environment Updates
Check the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto/blob/2.3/CHANGELOG.md) for any new environment variables that need to be added.

Always backup your database before running migrations!
:::

```bash
# Run database migrations
php artisan migrate

# Run optimize clear
php artisan optimize:clear
```

::: warning Seeder Caution
Avoid using `php artisan db:seed` on existing installations as it may reset your settings and categories. Add default settings manually if needed.
:::

### Step 5: Storage and Assets

```bash
# Create storage link
php artisan storage:link
```

### Step 6: File Migration

Copy your existing files to the new installation:

```bash
# Copy uploaded files
cp -r /path/to/old-project/storage/app/public/* storage/app/public/

# Copy any custom assets
cp -r /path/to/old-project/public/storage/* public/storage/

# Copy custom themes (if any)
cp -r /path/to/old-project/packages/* packages/
```

::: info File Locations
If you've changed default storage paths or have custom file locations, ensure you copy those as well.

### Step 7: Final Optimization

```bash
# Clear all the cache
php artisan optimize:clear
```
