## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

Ensure all tests pass before submitting your pull request:

**Pest Tests (Unit/Feature Tests):**

To run Pest tests, navigate to your project's root directory and use the following commands:

```bash
# Run the full test suite
php artisan test

# Run specific test files
php artisan test tests/Feature/YourTestFile.php

# Run tests with coverage
php artisan test --coverage
```

**Playwright Tests (End-to-End Tests):**

To run Playwright tests, navigate to the root directory of either the `Shop` or `Admin` package, then execute:

```bash
# Run Playwright tests from the package root
npx playwright test --config=tests/e2e-pw/playwright.config.ts
```

This command will execute all end-to-end tests defined in the Playwright configuration for the selected package.

::: tip Prerequisite
Before running Playwright tests, ensure you have both `npx` and `playwright` installed in your development environment.
:::

**Pint Tests (Code Formatting):**

Pint is a PHP code style fixer that helps maintain consistent formatting across the codebase. It automatically applies standards like PSR-2 and PSR-12, making your code cleaner and easier to review. Before committing, run Pint to ensure your changes follow the project's coding standards.

```bash
# Check code formatting
vendor/bin/pint --test

# Fix code formatting
vendor/bin/pint
```

::: warning Important
All three test types (Pest, Playwright, and Pint) must pass before your PR can be merged. Run tests locally to avoid CI failures.
