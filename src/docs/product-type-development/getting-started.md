# Getting Started

Creating custom product types in Bagisto allows you to define specialized product behaviors that perfectly match your business needs. Whether you need subscription products, rental items, digital services, or complex product variations, custom product types provide the flexibility to create exactly what your store requires.

For our tutorial, we'll create a **Subscription Product** type that demonstrates all the essential concepts you need to build any type of custom product solution.

## Understanding Bagisto Product Type Architecture

Bagisto's product system is built around a flexible type-based architecture that separates product behavior from data storage:

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Product Types Configuration** | Defines product type properties | `Config/product-types.php` |
| **Product Type Classes** | Contains business logic for product behavior | `Type/ClassName.php` |
| **`AbstractType` Base Class** | Provides core functionality | Extended by custom classes |
| **Service Provider** | Registers product type | `Providers/ServiceProvider.php` |

### Key Features

- **Flexible Product Behavior**: Custom logic for pricing, inventory, cart operations
- **Type-specific Validation**: Different validation rules per product type
- **Custom Attributes**: Type-specific product attributes and fields
- **Admin Integration**: Seamless integration with product creation interface

## Development Workflow

The typical workflow for creating a custom product type follows these steps:

### 1. Create Your Product Type
Build a complete working product type with all essential components.

**ðŸ“– [Create Your First Product Type â†’](./create-your-first-product-type.md)**

This section shows you how to build a complete working product type, then the remaining sections help you understand how to customize each component.

### 2. Understand Product Type Configuration
Learn how product type configuration works and how to customize product type properties.

**ðŸ“– Next:** [Understanding Product Type Configuration](./understanding-product-type-configuration.md)

### 3. Understand AbstractType Methods
Master the key methods available for implementing custom product behavior and business logic.

**ðŸ“– Next:** [Understanding AbstractType Class](./understanding-abstract-type-class.md)

### 4. Build Complete Implementation
See how to put it all together in a production-ready subscription product type.

**ðŸ“– Next:** [Building Your Subscription Product Type](./building-your-subscription-product-type.md)

You'll have a complete working product type after step 1, and steps 2-4 help you understand how to customize and extend it.
