# Getting Started

Creating custom shipping methods in Bagisto allows you to tailor delivery options to meet your specific business needs. Whether you need special handling for fragile items, express delivery options, or region-specific shipping rules, custom shipping methods provide the flexibility your e-commerce store requires.

For our tutorial, we'll create a **Custom Express Shipping** method that demonstrates all the essential concepts you need to build any type of shipping solution.

::: info Learning Objectives
By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:
- Understand Bagisto's shipping architecture and components
- Create custom shipping methods using both generator and manual approaches
- Configure admin interfaces for shipping method settings
- Implement advanced rate calculation logic
- Test and deploy custom shipping methods in production

## Understanding Bagisto Shipping Architecture

Bagisto's shipping system is built around a flexible carrier-based architecture that separates configuration from business logic:

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Carriers Configuration** | Defines shipping method properties and metadata | `Config/carriers.php` |
| **Carrier Classes** | Contains business logic for rate calculation | `Carriers/ClassName.php` |
| **System Configuration** | Admin interface forms for method settings | `Config/system.php` |
| **Service Provider** | Registers shipping method with Bagisto core | `Providers/ServiceProvider.php` |

### Key Features

- **Flexible Rate Calculation**: Support for per-unit, per-order, weight-based, or custom pricing models
- **Configuration Management**: Admin-friendly settings interface with validation
- **Multi-channel Support**: Different rates and settings per sales channel
- **Localization Ready**: Full translation support for international stores
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy integration with third-party APIs and services

## Development Workflow

The typical workflow for creating a custom shipping method follows these steps:

### 1. Setup and Structure
Choose between package generator (quick) or manual setup (educational) to create your shipping method foundation.

### 3. Build Admin Interface
Create configuration forms that allow administrators to manage shipping method settings.

**ðŸ“– Next:** [Understanding System Configuration](./understanding-system-configuration.md)

### 4. Implement Advanced Logic
Add sophisticated rate calculation, API integrations, and business rules.

**ðŸ“– Next:** [Advanced Rate Calculation Examples](./advanced-rate-calculation-examples.md)

## Prerequisites
