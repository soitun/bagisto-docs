## Understanding Bagisto Payment Architecture

Bagisto's payment system is built around a flexible method-based architecture that separates configuration from business logic:

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Payment Methods Configuration** | Defines payment method properties and metadata | `Config/payment_methods.php` |
| **Payment Classes** | Contains business logic for payment processing | `Payment/ClassName.php` |
| **System Configuration** | Admin interface forms for method settings | `Config/system.php` |
| **Service Provider** | Registers payment method with Bagisto core | `Providers/ServiceProvider.php` |

### Key Features

- **Flexible Payment Processing**: Support for redirects, APIs, webhooks, or custom payment flows
- **Configuration Management**: Admin-friendly settings interface with validation
- **Multi-channel Support**: Different settings per sales channel
- **Security Ready**: Built-in CSRF protection and secure payment handling
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy integration with third-party payment gateways

## Development Workflow

The typical workflow for creating a custom payment method follows these steps:

### 1. Setup and Structure
Choose between package generator (quick) or manual setup (educational) to create your payment method foundation.
