## Understanding Bagisto Payment Architecture

Bagisto's payment system is built around a flexible method-based architecture that separates configuration from business logic:

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Payment Methods Configuration** | Defines payment method properties | `Config/payment_methods.php` |
| **Payment Classes** | Contains payment processing logic | `Payment/ClassName.php` |
| **System Configuration** | Admin interface forms | `Config/system.php` |
| **Service Provider** | Registers payment method | `Providers/ServiceProvider.php` |

### Key Features

- **Flexible Payment Processing**: Support for redirects, APIs, webhooks, or custom flows
- **Configuration Management**: Admin-friendly settings interface
- **Multi-channel Support**: Different settings per sales channel
- **Security Ready**: Built-in CSRF protection and secure handling
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy integration with third-party gateways

## Development Workflow

The typical workflow for creating a custom payment method follows these steps:

### 1. Create Your Payment Method
Choose between package generator (quick) or manual setup (educational) to create a complete working payment method.

**ðŸ“– [Create Your First Payment Method â†’](./create-your-first-payment-method.md)**

This section shows you how to build a complete working payment method, then the remaining sections help you understand how to customize each component.

### 2. Understand Payment Configuration
Learn how payment configuration works and how to customize payment method properties.

**ðŸ“– Next:** [Understanding Payment Configuration](./understanding-payment-configuration.md)

### 3. Understand Payment Logic
Explore how the payment class handles processing and payment method behavior.

**ðŸ“– Next:** [Understanding Payment Class](./understanding-payment-class.md)

You'll have a complete working payment method after step 1, and steps 2-3 help you understand how to customize and extend it.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Bagisto Installation**: A working Bagisto development environment
- **PHP Knowledge**: Familiarity with PHP 8.1+ and Laravel concepts
- **Package Development**: Basic understanding of Laravel service providers ([Package Development Guide](../package-development/getting-started.md))
- **Development Tools**: Composer, Git, and a code editor

::: tip Quick Start Path
