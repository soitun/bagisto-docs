## Performance Architecture

### Multi-Layer Caching Strategy
Bagisto implements a sophisticated caching ecosystem designed for maximum performance:

| **Cache Layer** | **Purpose** | **Performance Gain** |
|---|---|---|
| **Full Page Cache (FPC)** | Complete page rendering cache | 80-90% faster page loads |
| **Varnish Cache** | HTTP reverse proxy caching | Sub-100ms response times |
| **Database Query Cache** | Optimized query result storage | 60-70% database load reduction |
| **Asset Bundling** | Static resource optimization | 50% fewer HTTP requests |

### High-Performance Runtime
- **Laravel Octane Integration**: Supercharged application performance with Swoole/RoadRunner
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations for critical user interactions
- **Memory-Resident Applications**: Persistent application state for lightning-fast responses

### Enterprise Search & Indexing
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Advanced full-text search with sub-second response times
- **Smart Product Indexing**: Optimized catalog browsing and filtering
- **Real-time Search Suggestions**: Enhanced customer discovery experience
